# CardEngine
A C# engine library for simulating card games. Includes a full NUnit TDD suite. A demo gameloop is provided in CardEngine/Program.cs. Implementation of various functions used in demo are found in CardEngine.Library.

For this project, I've referred to various specification pages across the web for proper syntax and function useage.

These specification pages include:
